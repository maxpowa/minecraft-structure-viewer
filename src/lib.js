// The library is loaded at runtime from jsDelivr, pinned to a commit for
// now: commit urls are immutable so the CDN can never serve stale files
// (the latest-v2 alias kept old copies cached). switches to version-pinned
// urls once the library starts releasing. VITE_LIB_URL overrides (e.g. a
// localhost dev server). The app owns the three instance and hands it over,
// so there is only ever one copy of three.
