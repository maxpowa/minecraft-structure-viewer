# Progress

Update this file with every commit. It is the handoff document: a fresh session with no
other context must be able to resume from here (read docs/PLAN.md and docs/SOURCES.md
first, then this).

## State

- Phase: 0 (research). Repo initialised, plan + sources written.
- Read so far from the old code: nbt.js (fully), transforms.js (fully),
  full SV commit history (both pages of `git log v2-dev -- projects/structure-viewer ...`).
- NOT yet read: app.js, optimise.js, jigsaw.js, combine.js, generators/*, walk.js,
  structure.html, style.css. Read them via `git show v2-dev:projects/structure-viewer/<f>`
  in the BlockModelRenderer repo, and mine the July 5 transcript per SOURCES.md.
- docs/DECISIONS.md not started: it must capture, per area, the behaviours + the bugs
  that were fixed (walk physics constants, jigsaw overlap rules, optimiser passes,
  door handling, centring rules, seed semantics) BEFORE that area is reimplemented.

## Next steps

1. Read the remaining old modules; write docs/DECISIONS.md area by area
   (jigsaw+transforms+combine, generators, optimiser, walk, app behaviours).
2. Mine the July 5 transcript for decisions not visible in code/commits.
3. Commit docs. Then scaffold Vite + Vue 3 app (PLAN.md build order step 1).

## Environment notes

- Ewan hosts `http://localhost:8080/` serving the BlockModelRenderer repo (library dev
  CDN stand-in). Playwright MCP is the browser-testing tool (NOT the preview MCP).
- Vite dev server: run in background, test pages with Playwright against it.
- Do not run npm render scripts in the library repo; visual verification is Ewan's.
- Commit style: lowercase, terse, subject well under 72 chars, body only when it earns
  its place, never any attribution. No emdashes in ANY prose or code, ever
  (rephrase with colon/comma/parentheses); do not strip them from quoted material.
